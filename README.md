In this project we are conducting an experimental research on whether there is a correlated relationship between Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP and the portion of Government expenditure that is derived from tax revenue. To accurately evaluate this stability value, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between tax revenue and government expenditure is essential.

The data extraction was facilitated through the Wikipedia API, utilizing snippets of information based on the page's title or text location. The dataset focuses on the tax revenue to GDP ratio for various countries

Our approach involved applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize countries into distinct groups based on their tax revenue and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP. We chose three clusters to represent low, medium, and high economic health, aiming to offer a nuanced understanding of the economic landscape.

Applying K-Means clustering would focus on the identified features (Continent and Country), and reveal the similarities of distinct groups, as it is formed by the algorithm based on the features and the patterns it identifies in the data.
